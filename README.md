# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Use the standard libraries in python for finding linear regression.
2. Set variables for assigning dataset values.
3. Import linear regression from sklearn.
4. Predict the values of array.
5. Calculate the accuracy, confusion and classification report by importing the required modules from sklearn.
6. Obtain the graph.

## Program:
```
